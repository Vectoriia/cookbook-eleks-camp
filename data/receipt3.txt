Shred, season, and marinate the cooked chicken:*Using two forks, shred the cooked chicken. (If starting with raw chicken, see How to Poach Chicken). Mix soy sauce, sherry and sugar in a bowl and add the chicken. Let soak for 10 minutes. Remove chicken and pat dry with paper towels.*2. Fry the bean threads in hot oil:*Put 3/4 inch of high smoke point cooking oil (such as canola oil or peanut oil) into a small saucepan. Heat on high heat until shimmering. Take one bunch of the dried bean threads and gently break them up a bit. Test the oil by putting one bean thread into the oil. If the oil is hot enough, the bean thread will almost immediately sizzle and puff up. That's when you know the oil is hot enough. When the oil is ready, working with a few bean threads at a time, put them in the hot oil. As soon as they puff up, remove them carefully with tongs and place them on a paper towel to cool. The paper towel helps remove any excess oil. Set aside.*3. Fry the shredded chicken:*In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil from the bean threads until hot.Add the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to bake in the seasoning. Set aside.*4. Slice green onions lengthwise:*Cut the green onions in 3 to 4 inch long pieces, and shred them lengthwise.*5. Toast the chopped almonds and sesame seeds:*Toast the chopped almonds, or chop your toasted almonds; toast your sesame seeds. (Heat a thin skillet to medium high heat, add the seeds - or nuts, don't do them both together - stir frequently until they begin to brown, remove from heat, they will continue to cook. Let cool to room temp.)*6. Make the dressing:*Put all of the dressing ingredients together in a jar—sugar, salt, pepper, vegetable oil, dark sesame oil, rice vinegar—cover with a lid and shake until emulsified.*7. Serve:*Just before serving the salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together - lettuce, chicken, bean threads, almonds, sesame seeds, and dressing.
