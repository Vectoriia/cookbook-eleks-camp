In a large sauté pan, over medium heat, add the olive oil and, once hot, sauté the onions and garlic until translucent, about 2 minutes.*2. Add the tomatoes and cook them with the onions and garlic for a couple of minutes, until softened.*3. Add the shredded chicken,olives, corn (if using), peas (if using), hearts of palm (if using), tomato sauce, hot sauce and stir to combine. Then, add the chicken broth and the flour dissolved in milk. Lower the heat to medium low and cook, stirring often, until most of the liquid is gone and the filling is creamy and lightly thickened, about 10 minutes.*4. Add the chopped parsley and stir to incorporate.*5. Taste for seasoning and season with salt and pepper to taste.*6.Cool completely before assembling the pie.*7. Combine the flour and the salt in a large bowl.*8. Add the egg yolks and stir using a wooden spoon.*9. Then add the butter and use your fingers to work the butter into the flour, until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Add the water, a few tablespoons of a time, and continue working with your fingers until the dough comes together. You might not need all the water!*10. Wrap the dough and chill for 20 minutes.*11. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. When the dough is chill, cut 1/3 of the dough and reserve. Roll out the remaining dough to about 12" round. Place the pastry in a 9-inch spring form pan, making sure the dough also covers the sides (since we have lots of filling!), and prick it all over with a fork.*12. Add the cold filling, smoothing it out so its evenly distributed.*13. Then, roll out the remaining dough and place it on top of the filling, sealing the pie and tucking the edges.*14. Using a knife, make two cuts in the center of the top crust, so that steam can escape while baking.*15. Brush the pie with the lightly beaten egg yolk. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown and the filling piping hot.*16. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.
